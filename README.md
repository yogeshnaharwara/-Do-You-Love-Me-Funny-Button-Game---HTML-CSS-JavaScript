"Do You Love Me?" Funny Button Game - HTML, CSS & JavaScript
Overview
This is a fun and interactive web project created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The idea is simple yet playful:

If the user tries to click "No", the button moves away quickly!

If the user clicks "Yes", a sweet love message pops up.

Itâ€™s a mini-project focused on DOM manipulation, CSS transitions, and basic event handling.

Features
Cute Design: Simple, colorful, and attractive layout.

Moving "No" Button: The "No" button avoids being clicked by moving randomly across the screen.

Popup Alert: Clicking "Yes" triggers a cute message.

Responsive Layout: Works well on different screen sizes.

Playful Interaction: Designed to make users smile and have fun.

Technologies Used
HTML5: For structuring the webpage.

CSS3: For styling, layout, and smooth transitions.

JavaScript (Vanilla JS): For interactivity and button movement.

How it Works
Open the page â†’ Youâ€™ll see a question: "Do You Love Me?"

Two buttons appear: "Yes" and "No".

Trying to click "No" makes the button jump to random places.

Clicking "Yes" shows a cute love message popup (alert()).

Contributing

Add background music when the page loads.

Make "No" button shrink or rotate while running away.

Show an animation after clicking "Yes".
